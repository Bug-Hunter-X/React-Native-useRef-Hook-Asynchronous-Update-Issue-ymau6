This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a function component that has an asynchronous operation. The issue arises because the ref's value might not be updated immediately after the component renders, leading to unexpected behavior if you try to access it before it's ready.  For example, if you're trying to access the ref's `current` property within a `useEffect` hook that runs immediately after render, the ref's value might still be null or undefined.
