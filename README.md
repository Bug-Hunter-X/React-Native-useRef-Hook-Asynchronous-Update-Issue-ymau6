# React Native useRef Hook Asynchronous Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with asynchronous operations. The problem arises because the ref's value might not be updated immediately after rendering, causing unexpected behavior if accessed before it's ready.  The solution involves carefully managing the timing of access to the ref's `current` property using a combination of the `useRef` hook, `useEffect` hook, and potentially state management to ensure the asynchronous operation is complete before using the ref.

## Bug Description

The bug showcases a scenario where a ref is used to store a component's instance, but an attempt is made to access its properties before it's initialized due to an asynchronous operation.  This results in null or undefined errors.

## Solution

The solution addresses this by incorporating appropriate safeguards to only access the ref after its value has been properly assigned during an asynchronous process.
